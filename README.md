Using fetch, async, and await, you’ll request information from the Foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com) and OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/current) to create a travel website.

Before you begin, you’ll need to register for developer accounts for both of the APIs above. They’re both free.

For Foursquare, once you make an account, create a new app and fill out the form (you can put any link in the “App or Company URL” field). The Foursquare API will then give you a client ID and a client secret. You’ll need to save both of those in main.js.

For OpenWeather, When prompted, use your first name, and other for the OpenWeather questions for their data collection. OpenWeather will give you an API Key, which you’ll also need to save in main.js.
